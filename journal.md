The only thing i really found interesting for me is dev opps because they're like behind the scenes and every thing. They are the one's who control stuff, it's also a really cool name. You learn about the file system, packet manageres, and managing services and checking logs, ect. To be one you need to learn about a dock, git, aws, terraform, and more. That's all i got from it so I hope i can become a dev opp.

Today, i did some coding and it isn't as hard as i thought. It was pretty fum amd  interesting it's something i haven't done. 
I'm really excited to dive more deeper into it. I was coding a [flappy bird](https://studio.code.org/flappy/6) game amd

Today I did code hs and i just got a test done. it was a little confusing at first but im willing to learn more about coding.
